# Project Summary: Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project aimed to predict the forest cover type in the Roosevelt National Forest using various machine learning models. The dataset contained cartographic variables like elevation, aspect, slope, and soil type, which were used to classify seven different forest cover types.

# Key Steps in the Project:
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
  - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the datasetâ€™s structure and distributions.
  - Checked for missing values, outliers, and data imbalances.
  - Normalized numerical features and encoded categorical features for better model performance.

2. Model Training & Comparison:
  - Implemented multiple classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost.
  - Used train-test split and cross-validation to ensure robustness.
  - Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

3. Challenges Faced & Solutions:
  - High Dimensionality: The dataset had 40 soil-type features, making model training complex. Solution: Used feature selection techniques and tree-based models that handle high dimensions well.
  - Class Imbalance: Some cover types were underrepresented. Solution: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and class-weighted algorithms.
  - Computational Complexity: Models like SVM and XGBoost were slow on large data. Solution: Used Random Forest, which provided a balance between speed and accuracy.

# Conclusion & Best Model for Production

After comparing multiple models, Random Forest emerged as the best performer, offering high accuracy and generalizability while handling high-dimensional data efficiently. XGBoost also performed well but required more tuning.

For production deployment, Random Forest is recommended due to its interpretability, speed, and robustness in handling diverse feature sets. Future improvements could include deep learning approaches or hybrid models for even better accuracy.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged for environmental monitoring, helping in forest management and conservation. ðŸŒ²âœ¨
